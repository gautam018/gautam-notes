## Hi

Hi, nice meeting you. I am Gautam from India. I am a software developer and a passionate artificial intelligent learner and tutor. I love to spread my knowledge to others through these blogs and via various forms in the coming future. I am doing this as my passion to spread knowledge because I strongly believe in "The way you learn things is by explaining it to others" and secondly to document my learning. Initial blogs might not be soo good ,I understand ,and thank you in advance for going through my blogs but I promise over the time I will improve my writing and explaining style.

Thank you,

Regards <br>
Gautam Gottipati
